1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,260
Everyone, please listen to me.

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,840
We, as Huma and Gajuma, were walking a path
of coexistence as neighbors and good friends.

3
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,820
Despite that, now we have begun fighting
over the differences between our races...

4
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,220
...and for that reason alone.

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,560
Things aren't that simple!

6
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,280
We're just trying to set things right!

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,240
Isn't the Queen supposed to be on our side?

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,740
What even is race?

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,660
Though we differ in appearance,

10
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,820
in times of joy we laugh. and in
times of sorrow we shed tears.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,540
Why is that?

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,300
It is because our hearts are the same.

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,540
Is that really the Queen?

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,540
This is what I believeー

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,140
that the body is nothing more than
a vessel which houses the heart.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,980
Even should there be a thing such as raceー

17
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,220
ーIt is not "Gajuma" or "Huma," but rather
one <Yellow>Mankind<White> that shares this earth.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,720
I ask you all to remember...

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,100
We have all had times where we've shared
laughter, tears, sorrow, and joy...

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,880
...Times where we have been treated with
kindness.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,160
and times where we have eaten delicious
food with one another...

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,400
I know of a village, where whenever one of the
ladies bakes pies, everyone gathers together.

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,320
It doesn't matter if they're Huma or Gajuma.
Everyone eats together and says "How Delicious!"

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,160
Don't let her fool you! She's trying to
win us over because she values her life!

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,920
I say this not because I fear death,

26
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,560
but because I believe that living when
everyone you love hates one another

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,400
is a fate as cruel as death...

28
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,640
Your Majesty...

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,540
That's...not Agarte...

30
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,920
I want you to listen to my last request.

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,400
If there is ever a time where you eat a
pie...a peach pie...

32
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,580
I want you to close your eyes and think
about this.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,500
In that heart of yours which
finds it so delicious...

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,360
Is there such a thing as race?

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,640
Let's move!

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,960
Claire!!

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,600
Why you...!

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,400
Claire!!

39
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,280
<Veigue>!!

40
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,700
Move! Out of my way!

41
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,920
<Veigue>!!

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,680
Claire!!

43
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,960
Claire... You're Claire...

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,850
I always believed, that no
matter what I looked like

45
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,080
you would come to realize that it was me...

46
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,640
Claire...
